# Required LaTeX Packages for HAFiscal Project
# Last updated: 2025-12-10 (added missing packages from old GA workflow: accents, soul, amstext, etc.)
#
# This file lists all LaTeX packages required to compile HAFiscal.tex and HAFiscal-Slides.tex
# with ONLY texlive-latex-base + texlive-latex-recommended installed.
#
# Packages marked with ✓ were verified essential through iterative compilation.
# Packages marked with ❌ were removed as unnecessary.
#
# Total packages needed beyond base+recommended: ~62 (includes beamer and pgf for presentations)

# NOTE: The following packages are NOT listed here because they are already included
#       in collection-basic or base LaTeX: amsfonts, amsmath, amssymb, amstext, amsthm, array, babel, caption, color, enumerate, epstopdf, expl3, fancyhdr, float, fontenc, geometry, graphicx, hyperref, inputenc, l3kernel, l3packages, natbib, verbatim
#       The setup script (setup.sh) handles these automatically.
