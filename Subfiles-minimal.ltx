\section{Introduction}
This trimmed version preserves the full section structure while removing most narrative detail.

\subsection{Related literature}
The full literature review is omitted in this lightweight scaffold.

\section{Model}
We retain one representative equation for compilation and structure checks:
\begin{equation}
  C_t = \beta \, \mathbb{E}_t[C_{t+1}] + \varepsilon_t .
\end{equation}

\section{Parameterizing the model}
Calibration details are intentionally abbreviated.

\section{Comparing fiscal stimulus policies}
Most policy comparison text is removed; a minimal table is kept.

\begin{table}[htbp]

  \caption{Illustrative policy comparison}
  \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \toprule
    Policy & Spending effect & Welfare effect \\
    \midrule
    Stimulus check & Medium & Medium \\
    UI extension & High & High \\
    Tax cut & Low & Low \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Robustness in a HANK and SAM Model}
Detailed robustness analysis is omitted.

\section{Conclusion}
Main takeaways are intentionally shortened for the stripped document version.
